# thesis_code
Eidos (SLiM) code accompanying my Master's thesis entitled "Investigating the spread of ancestry using forward-in-time spatial population genetic simulations".

Also provided is some example R and Shell code which can be used to generate figures seen in the thesis. The code is provided in [the first continuous spatial model directory](Section_3.7_first_spatial), but nearly identical code is used throughout the other continuous spatial model sections.

For further information, please email dg622@cam.ac.uk.
